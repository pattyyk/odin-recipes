         Originally made by Preppy Kitchen, but I found it a bit too sweet,
            so I adjusted the sweetness according to my taste :)

            <li>Transfer the cake batter to the cake tin.</li>
            <li> Fill a larger baking tray with 1cm of boiling water and place the cake tin in the tray</li>

            <li>Cut the cake into three equal layers.</li>

            <li>Repeat and cover with the final sponge layer</li>
            <li> Using an offset spatula cover the cake in a thin layer of cream, spinning the turntable as you go to create a smooth finish.</li>
